# Local-Food-Wastage-Management-System
Developed a Food Management System to efficiently track food providers and receivers, optimize food distribution, and reduce waste through data-driven insights.
# 🍴 Food Management System  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Food Management System** is designed to streamline the process of managing food providers and receivers, optimizing food distribution, and reducing food waste. The project leverages data analysis, visualization, and reporting techniques to provide actionable insights for better decision-making.
